project: Notarify

---
In the context of the business incentives outlined in "Legge Provinciale n.6/1999," the Provincia Autonoma di Trento has awarded a grant to B-Zero Srl (B-Zero), an innovative startup focused on blockchain data notarization. B-Zero has commissioned the Security&Trust Unit of FBK's Cybersecurity Center to provide technical-scientific support to explore and integrate Italian digital identity solutions, such as "Sistema Pubblico di Identità Digitale" (SPID) and "Carta d’Identità Elettronica" (CIE), into B-Zero's platform called "Notarify." The project aims to offer support and identify the best methodologies to ensure the effectiveness, security, and compliance of these solutions.
